This is my profile; an updated version from my first site. 

- I decided to use ReactJS and Vite because of my previous web development class; I also enjoy the ability to reuse components. 
- I use Nginx to run my site due to its speed and novelty.
- I needed a way to make my site available without paying for a service. I use Tor to host my site for free; another benefit includes supporting an open source project protecting privacy.
